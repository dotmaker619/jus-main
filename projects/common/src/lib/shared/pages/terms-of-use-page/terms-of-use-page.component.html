  <h2>
    DISPUTE RESOLUTION
</h2>
<br>
<h3>
  Informal Negotiations
</h3>

  <p>
    To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to the Agreement (each a
    “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the
    “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided
    below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence
    upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
</p>

  <h3>
    Binding Arbitration
</h3>

  <p>
    If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes
    expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis.
    <strong><u>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY
      TRIAL</u></strong>. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
    American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
    Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration
    fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate,
    limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined to by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all
    arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by
    phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless
    requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the
    arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the
    arbitration will take place in New York, NY. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to
    compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the
    award entered by the arbitrator.
</p>

  <p>
    If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted
    in the state and federal courts located in New York, NY, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of
    lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and
    federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and The
    Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from the Agreement.
</p>

  <h3>
    Restrictions
</h3>

  <p>
    The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full
    extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or
    authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c)
    there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the
    general public or any other persons.
</p>

  <h3>
    Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
</h3>

  <p>
    The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations
    and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the
    intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
    invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
    illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
    provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction
    within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
    court.
