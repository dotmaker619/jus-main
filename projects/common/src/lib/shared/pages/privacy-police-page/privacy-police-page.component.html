      Information, questions concerning your legal needs, or other questions or feedback related to the Service (as

        <li>
          Location information, including the physical location of your device. This information may be captured in a
          variety of ways, including through the use of tracking technologies such as Cookies (which are small files
          containing a string of alphanumeric characters) that we send to your computer or mobile device, web beacons or
          clear GIFs (which are small strings of code that provide a means to deliver a GIF for tracking purposes) that we

  <h2>
    4) Information Sharing & Disclosure
  </h2>

  <p>
    We do not sell your Personal Information. To make the Site and Service work, we may need to share your personal
    information with other users, third parties, and service providers. This section explains when and why we share your
    information.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>All Personal Information Except Attorney-Client Communications</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>
    4.1) General Disclosure Practices
  </h3>

  <p>
    We may disclose your information in connection with our business operations and the provision of the Site and Service.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Your Public Contributions will be available to anyone who is able to access that content, including other users of
      the Site or Service. We (as well as others with access to the information over whom we may not have any influence or
      control) may collect, store, and use this information in any way.
    </li>
    <li>
      We work with third party service providers to help us run our business. These third party service providers provide
      services that include (without limitation) website and application development and support, payment processors and
      financial services providers, IT providers (including hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services and support and
      maintenance providers), data storage, maintenance, legal advisors and other professional services, and marketing and
      promotions management. To the extent it is necessary for these third party service providers to complete their
      contractual obligations to us, these third parties may have access to or process your information. All third party
      service providers that process your personal information on our behalf are contractually obligated to respect the
      confidentiality of such personal information. These third party service providers may be located in a jurisdiction
      that does not provide the same level of data protection as the jurisdiction in which you reside.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <h3>
    4.2) Compliance with Law, Responding to Legal Requests, and Protecting Our Rights
  </h3>

  <span>
    We may disclose your information to law enforcement, regulators, governmental authorities, courts, tax authorities,
    attorneys, and others for the following reasons:
  </span>
  <ul>
    <li>
      if we are required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with law
      (including copyright law), in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to
      otherwise cooperate with law or government enforcement activity;
    </li>
    <li>
      in our good faith belief that doing so is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability and/or to
      investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations;
    </li>
    <li>
      to protect Jus-Law from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity and to protect the security or integrity
      of the Service and the rights, property, or safety of Jus-Law, our customers and users, or others.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Where appropriate, we may notify users about legal requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal
    process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be
    futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of
    fraud upon Jus-Law property, its users, and the Site and Service. In instances where we comply with legal requests
    without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that user about the request after the fact where
    appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.
  </p>

  <h3>
    4.3) Business Transfers
  </h3>

  <span>
  We understand that information exchanged with an attorney via a private chat function is subject to heightened
  confidentiality concerns and it is our policy to protect this information to the fullest extent permitted by law. For
  this reason, JusGlobal does not and will not access, use or disclose Attorney-Client Communications except:
  </span>

  <ul>
    <li>
      as required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with law, a court order,
      subpoena or warrant, or otherwise to cooperate with law enforcement, regulators, governmental authorities, courts,
      or other authorities, in which case we may access or use your information and disclose it to law enforcement,
      regulators, governmental authorities, courts, tax authorities, attorneys, or other authorities;
    </li>
    <li>
      as necessary to investigate or defend against any claims of illegality or wrongdoing (whether those claims relate to
      Jus-Law’s actions or to your actions when using the Site or Service), in which case we may access or use your
      information and disclose it to law enforcement, regulators, governmental authorities, courts, tax authorities,
      attorneys, or others;
    </li>
    <li>
      as necessary to protect the security or integrity of the Service (including in connection with any information
      technology issue or instance of compromised security) or the rights, property, or safety of Jus-Law’s our customers
      and users, or others, in which case we may access or use your information and disclose it to anyone reasonably
      necessary to assist us with these goals, including our IT providers;
    </li>
    <li>
      disclosure to our hosting providers, including Amazon Web Services, in connection with their provision of data
      hosting services; and
    </li>
    <li>
      in the event Jus-Law undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets,
      bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your
      information in connection with such transaction or in contemplation of such transaction (e.g., due diligence) with
      or to buyers or purchasers (or potential buyers or purchasers) and their representatives.

      the past twelve months, the categories of sources of that information, our business or commercial purposes for
      collecting the information, and the categories of third parties with whom the information was shared;
    </li>
    <li>
      submit a request for deletion of Personal Information, subject to certain exceptions, including (without limitation)
      in the event that we may need to retain Personal Information to complete the transaction for which the Personal
      Information was collected, detect security incidents or protect against illegal activity, exercise free speech,
      comply with a legal obligation, or for lawful internal use compatible with the context in which the information was
      provided by you. If your request is subject to any exception, we may deny your request to delete your data. Please

  <h2>
    6) Security
  </h2>

  <p>
    We employ appropriate safeguards that are designed to protect the integrity and security of your information. No
    security measures are perfect or impenetrable, however, so we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
    you transmit to us through the Site or Service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such
    information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards. We cannot
    control the actions of other users or other third parties with whom you may choose to share your information and
    therefore we cannot and do not guarantee that information you post through the Site or Service will not be viewed by
    unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained
    on the Site or in the Service.
  </p>

  <p>
    We retain your information for as long as it is reasonably necessary and relevant for our operations, and/or to comply
    with legal or regulatory requirements, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any
    investigation, or enforce our Jus-Law Terms of Use or other agreements (including the Jus-Law Customer Subscription
    Agreement, as applicable). After removal, copies of information that you have posted may remain viewable in cached and

    expressly and unconditionally release and hold us harmless from any and all liability for any injuries, loss, or
    damage of any kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or misuse of such information. In addition, while we

  <h3>
    7.3) Third-Party Content
  </h3>

  <p>
    Third-party content may be linked to or otherwise incorporated into the Site or the Service. For example, we may
    implement or allow third party advertising or other content on the Site and within the Service that may utilize web
    beacons, Cookies or similar tracking technologies placed or controlled by the third-party content provider.
    Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may allow a third
    party to collect information about you through their browser Cookies, even when you do not interact with the button.
    Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data policies. Jus-Law does
    not control and is not responsible for the content or privacy and data protection practices of third-party websites,
    applications, services, goods, or advertisements that may be linked to or otherwise incorporated into the Site or
    Service. If you link to or otherwise interact with third-party content, you do so at your own risk. Jus-Law does not
    endorse, recommend, or make any representations or warranties regarding websites, applications, services, goods, or
    advertisements that may be linked to or otherwise incorporated into the Site or Service.

  <h3>
    7.4) Do Not Track Disclosures
  </h3>

  <p>
    Third parties such as advertising networks, analytics providers, and others may collect information about your online
    activities over time and across different websites when you access or use the Site or Service. Currently, various
    browsers offer a Do Not Track (“DNT”) option, but there is no standard for how DNT should work on commercial websites.
    Due to lack of such standards, the Site does not respond to Do Not Track browser settings.
  </p>

  <h3>
    7.5) Children’s Data
  </h3>

  <p>
    Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not allow children under 13
    years of age to use the Site or Service, we do not knowingly collect or maintain information from persons under 13
    years of age, and no part of the Site or Service is directed to persons under 13 years of age. If you are under 13
    years of age, then please do not use or access the Site or Service at any time or in any manner. If we learn that
    information has been collected through the Site or Service from persons under 13 years of age and without verifiable
    parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian
    and discover that your child under 13 years of age has obtained a Jus-Law account or provided us with information,
    please alert us at <a href="mailto:info@jus-law.com" target="_blank">info@jus-law.com</a> to request that we delete
    the information from our systems.
